Programming Language:
C++

Instructions:
1. To compile, simply, type "make" at the terminal (without the quotes).
2. To run the program type "./cipher <CIPHER NAME> <KEY> <ENG/DEC> <INPUTFILE> <OUTPUT FILE>"

    <CIPHER NAME> : Name of the cipher to use. Valid names are:
        PLF: Playfair
        RTS: Row Transposition
        RFC: Railfence
        VIG: Vigenre
        CES: Caesar
    <KEY> : The encryption key to use.
    <ENC/DEC> : Choose wheter to encrypt or decrypt, respectively.
    <INPUT FILE> : the file from which to read the input.
    <OUTPUT FILE> : the file to which the output shall be written

 Extra Credit:
 We did not implement the extra credit.

 Notes:
 1. Railfence Cipher will add extra characters to the end of the plaintext in order to 
 fit a matrix according to the key the user inputs. The added characters start at 'a' 
 then 'b' and so on until it fits the correct matrix size.
